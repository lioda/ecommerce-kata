Computing an e-commerce cart balance.
The aim of this kata is to practice TDD, think about the domain model and improve skills.

## First Step

We need to compute the cart total balance of an online grocery.

For this first step, we need to take care of 3 products:

- `Pens`, with a price of `0.75$ per unit`
- `Soda Cans`, with a price of `1.5$ per unit`
- `Potatoes`, with a price of `1.99$ per kilogram`

## Second Step

The grocery propose now a special offer:

- A 3 `Pens` bundle at the price of `2$`

## Third Step

New offer:

- Buy 2 `Soda Cans` and get `1 free`
